# Overview

This is example of using memory manager that can be found [here](https://github.com/DevMain1953/c-sharp-memory-management). The project is designed to manipulate 3D objects in 3D space in 32-bit processes. Implemented its own physics of movement in space, using:
- rotation matrix;
- movement direction vectors.
